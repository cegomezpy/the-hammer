The Hammer is an application made with AppInventor framework. Uses the google-sheets API to store the attendance records when a QR code with an student or worker information is scanned. Google sheet is read only by students when the link of the google sheet is shared with them. I could have used Redis server but it is faster to use google-sheets, also there is no sensitive information. 
The Hammer has another interesting implementation, it is a graphic quality control tool for engineer students and all who is familiarized with the tool. It is need quality-control knowledge to understand how it works and read the graphics properly, but with a brief research the user can understand the fundamentals.
The Hammer shows informations about the rules followed in the laboratory.
